## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/masoudigram/mikrotik-update-manager.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `devices.yaml` file in the backend directory:
```yaml
devices: []
```

2. Create an `os` directory in the project root to store RouterOS packages:
```bash
mkdir os
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìù Usage

1. **Adding Devices**:
   - Click "Add Device" in the interface
   - Enter the router's IP address, username, password, and ports
   - The system will automatically detect the architecture and current version

2. **Uploading Packages**:
   - Navigate to the package management section
   - Upload RouterOS package files (.npk) for different architectures
   - The system will organize packages by architecture

3. **Updating Routers**:
   - Select the target router(s)
   - Choose the desired RouterOS version
   - Initiate the update process
   - Monitor the progress in real-time

## üîí Security Considerations

- Store sensitive credentials securely
